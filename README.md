# Advent of Code

These are my solutions for the [Advent of Code event](https://adventofcode.com/). The inputs are inside each challenge folder, and the main function will print the answer to the terminal. Each year is done in a language.

## 2019 - JavaScript

- Run with `node ChallengeName.js` 

## 2020 - Java

- Build with `javac ChallengeName.java`
- Run with `java ChallengeName`
