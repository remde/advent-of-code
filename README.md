# Advent of Code

These are my Java solutions for the [Advent of Code event](https://adventofcode.com/). The inputs are inside each challenge folder, and the main function will print the answer to the terminal.

## Running the challenges

- Build with `javac Challenge.java`
- Run with `java Challenge`
